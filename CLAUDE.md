# CLAUDE.md — Lending Club Loan Portfolio Investment Analysis Tool

## Project Overview

Interactive Streamlit dashboard for analyzing a portfolio of ~2.2M Lending Club consumer loans. An investor can filter by pool strata, view credit/performance metrics, project cash flows under purchase price assumptions, and compare base/stress/upside scenarios with IRR calculations.

Three functional parts:
1. **Portfolio Analytics** — Pool stratifications, credit metrics, performance metrics, delinquency transitions
2. **Cash Flow Projection & IRR** — Monthly projected cash flows at pool level, IRR at a purchase price, price solver for target IRR
3. **Scenario Analysis** — Base/stress/upside comparison with user-adjustable multiplicative shifts

All three parts surface through a single Streamlit app (`app.py`) with sidebar filters and three tabs.

## Domain Terminology

> **For detailed formulas, worked examples, and edge cases, read `.claude/skills/lending-math/SKILL.md`.**
> **For full column reference and strata definitions, read `.claude/skills/data-schema/SKILL.md`.**

Key rates: SMM, CPR, MDR, CDR (conditional, annualized), Loss Severity, Recovery Rate, WAC, WAM, WALA, IRR. All formulas with derivations are in `docs/calculations.md` and the lending-math skill.

- **MDR (Monthly Default Rate, observed)**: For a given calendar month M: `MDR_M = defaults_in_month_M / performing_balance_at_start_of_month_M`. This parallels SMM for prepayments.
- **CDR (Conditional Default Rate)**: `CDR = 1 - (1 - avg_MDR)^12` where `avg_MDR` is the average of 12 trailing monthly MDRs (Apr 2018 – Mar 2019). This is the PRIMARY rate used in cash flow projections. Uses the dv01 conditional methodology. The performing balance denominator is prepayment-adjusted for active loans at the snapshot (cumulative prepayment spread evenly across loan age). Fully Paid / Charged Off loans use unadjusted amortization.
- **Cumulative Default Rate (reference only)**: `cumulative_default_rate = sum(defaulted_upb) / sum(funded_amnt)`. Raw lifetime default rate. Displayed for reference but NOT used in cash flow engine. Do NOT call this "CDR" — CDR refers only to the conditional (annualized) rate.
- **MDR (Monthly Default Rate, for projections)**: `MDR = 1 - (1 - CDR)^(1/12)`. The round-trip is: observe monthly MDRs → average → annualize to CDR → cash flow engine converts back to MDR via this formula.

## Data Details

### Source
Lending Club: `accepted_2007_to_2018Q4.csv` (~2.2M loans, 151 columns). Snapshot as of March 2019.

### Data Cleaning
Full cleaning pipeline with 21 steps is documented in `docs/data_cleaning.md`. Key points:
- **Column whitelist** (29 raw columns kept): `id`, `loan_status`, `funded_amnt`, `int_rate`, `term`, `installment`, `grade`, `sub_grade`, `purpose`, `addr_state`, `home_ownership`, `issue_d`, `last_pymnt_d`, `next_pymnt_d`, `last_credit_pull_d`, `out_prncp`, `total_rec_prncp`, `total_rec_int`, `total_rec_late_fee`, `last_pymnt_amnt`, `recoveries`, `collection_recovery_fee`, `fico_range_high`, `fico_range_low`, `last_fico_range_high`, `last_fico_range_low`, `dti`, `dti_joint`, `annual_inc`, `annual_inc_joint`, `application_type`
- **Engineered columns** (~17): `term_months`, `maturity_month`, `original_fico`, `latest_fico`, `dti_clean`, `annual_inc_clean`, `joint_app_flag`, `issue_quarter`, `issue_month_year`, `upb_lost`, various reclassification flags
- `int_rate` stored as decimal (0.1078), not percentage

### Data Context — Backsolve Capability

This is a single point-in-time snapshot (March 2019). No monthly servicing tapes. However, we reconstruct approximate monthly loan statuses using backsolve logic because Lending Club's delinquency progression is deterministic:

- **Delinquent (0-30)**: `last_pymnt_d + 1 month` (missed payment month — Grace + Late 16-30 combined)
- **Late (31-120)**: `delinquent_month + 1 month`
- **Default/Charged Off**: `delinquent_month + 4 months` (~120 days, terminal)
- **Fully Paid**: `payoff_month = last_pymnt_d`

**5 transition states**: Current, Delinquent (0-30), Late (31-120), Charged Off (absorbing), Fully Paid (absorbing).

Key constraints: Current cannot skip to Charged Off or Late (31-120). Late (31-120) cannot cure. Charged Off and Fully Paid are terminal.

These reconstructed transitions are used in Tab 1 for display and as the basis for age-specific transition probabilities in the state-transition cash flow model (Tabs 2 and 3).

## Function Reference

### Amortization & Analytics Functions

**`src/amortization.py`**:
- `calc_amort(df, ...) → pd.DataFrame` — Adds ~20 columns (orig_exp_*, last_pmt_*, next_pmt_*, updated_remaining_term, updated_maturity_date)
- Helpers: `calc_monthly_payment()`, `calc_balance()`, `calc_payment_num()`

**`src/portfolio_analytics.py`**:
- `calculate_credit_metrics(df, strata_col) → pd.DataFrame` — Requires calc_amort columns. Returns origination + active metrics by strata. Includes "ALL" row.
- `calculate_performance_metrics(df, vintage_col='issue_quarter') → pd.DataFrame` — Requires calc_amort columns. Returns CPR, CDR, loss severity by vintage.
- `calculate_transition_matrix(df, strata_col=None) → pd.DataFrame` — Flow-based transition probabilities.

### Display Functions (in `src/portfolio_analytics.py`)

These are display-only, do NOT feed into the cash flow engine. They use only base DB columns (no calc_amort dependency).

- `reconstruct_loan_timeline(df) → pd.DataFrame` — Adds 18 columns: loan_age_months, age_bucket, age_bucket_label, delinquent_month, late_31_120_month, default_month, payoff_month, delinquent_age, late_31_120_age, default_age, payoff_age, cured_from_late, late_1_month, late_2_month, late_3_month, late_1_age, late_2_age, late_3_age. Late sub-states computed from late_31_120_month: Late_1 = same, Late_2 = +1mo, Late_3 = +2mo.
- `get_loan_status_at_age(df, age, states='5state') → pd.Series` — Vectorized status at a specific loan age. In 5-state mode: Charged Off > Fully Paid > Late (31-120) > Delinquent (0-30) > Current. In 7-state mode: Charged Off > Fully Paid > Late_3 > Late_2 > Late_1 > Delinquent (0-30) > Current. Delinquent only at exact delinquent_age in 7-state mode.
- `compute_age_transition_probabilities(df, bucket_size=6, states='5state') → pd.DataFrame` — Empirical transition probabilities. In 5-state mode: per 6-month age bucket with 5 to_*_pct columns. In 7-state mode: supports bucket_size=1 (individual monthly ages) with 7 to_*_pct columns. Returns age_bucket, from_status, to_*_pct columns, observation_count.
- `TRANSITION_STATES_7` — Constant: `['Current', 'Delinquent (0-30)', 'Late_1', 'Late_2', 'Late_3', 'Charged Off', 'Fully Paid']`
- `compute_pool_transition_matrix(df_current, age_probs) → dict` — Dollar-flow matrix from age-specific probabilities applied to current pool UPB. Returns aggregate_matrix, aggregate_matrix_pct, breakdown_by_age.
- `compute_default_timing(df, group_col=None) → pd.DataFrame` — Default timing distribution by loan age. Returns default_age_months, loan_count, upb_amount, pct_of_defaults, cumulative_pct.
- `compute_loan_age_status_matrix(df, bucket_size=6) → pd.DataFrame` — Cross-sectional status distribution at each age bucket. Returns age_bucket, total_loans, total_upb, pct_current, pct_fully_paid, pct_charged_off, pct_late_grace.

### Cash Flow Functions (in `src/cashflow_engine.py`)

**Dashboard-active (used by `app.py`)**:
- `compute_pool_assumptions(df_all, df_active) → dict` — Base-case CDR (conditional, 12-month trailing average MDR, annualized via dv01 methodology), CPR, loss severity. Requires `reconstruct_loan_timeline()` to have been called on `df_all` first (for `default_month` and `payoff_month` columns). Returns `{'cdr': float, 'cumulative_default_rate': float, 'avg_mdr': float, 'monthly_mdrs': list[float], 'cpr': float, 'loss_severity': float, 'recovery_rate': float}`.
- `compute_pool_characteristics(df_active) → dict` — Pool aggregates: {total_upb, wac, wam, monthly_payment}.
- `calculate_irr(cashflows_df, pool_chars, purchase_price) → float` — Annualized IRR from projected cash flows.
- `build_pool_state(df, include_statuses=None) → dict` — Constructs initial pool state from loan DataFrame for state-transition model. Maps LC statuses to 7 model states. Returns `{'states': {state: {age: upb}}, 'total_upb', 'wac', 'wam', 'monthly_payment'}`.
- `project_cashflows_transition(pool_state, age_probs, loss_severity, recovery_rate, pool_chars, num_months) → pd.DataFrame` — State-transition monthly projection. Tracks UPB across 7 states with age-specific transition probabilities. Returns columns compatible with `calculate_irr()` plus state-specific UPB columns.
- `solve_price_transition(pool_state, age_probs, loss_severity, recovery_rate, pool_chars, num_months, target_irr) → float|None` — Brentq solver for transition model. Projects once (price-independent), then solves for price.

**Codebase-only (not used by dashboard, retained for reference/testing)**:
- `project_cashflows(pool_chars, cdr, cpr, loss_severity, purchase_price) → pd.DataFrame` — Flat CDR/CPR monthly projection loop.
- `solve_price(pool_chars, target_irr, cdr, cpr, loss_severity) → float` — Brentq solver for flat model.

### Scenario Functions (in `src/scenario_analysis.py`)

**Dashboard-active**:
- `compute_base_assumptions(df_all, df_active) → dict` — Wrapper for compute_pool_assumptions.
- `build_scenarios_transition(base_probs, stress_pct=0.15, upside_pct=0.15) → dict` — Applies multiplicative shifts to transition probabilities. Stress: increases delinquency, decreases cure rates. Late_3→Default NOT directly stressed. Returns `{'Base', 'Stress', 'Upside'}` probability DataFrames.
- `compare_scenarios_transition(pool_state, scenario_probs, loss_severity, recovery_rate, pool_chars, num_months, purchase_price) → pd.DataFrame` — Runs transition projections + IRR for each scenario.

**Codebase-only (not used by dashboard, retained for reference/testing)**:
- `build_scenarios(base_assumptions, stress_pct=0.15, upside_pct=0.15) → dict` — Multiplicative CDR/CPR shifts for flat model.
- `compare_scenarios(pool_chars, scenarios, purchase_price) → pd.DataFrame` — Runs flat projections + IRR for each scenario.

## Streamlit Dashboard (`app.py`)

> **For detailed layout templates and styling, read `.claude/skills/streamlit-patterns/SKILL.md`.**

### Layout
Single page with sidebar + 3 tabs.

### Sidebar Controls
1. **Strata Type** dropdown: grade, term_months, purpose, addr_state, issue_quarter, or ALL
2. **Strata Value** dropdown: populated dynamically. Disabled if ALL.

Purchase Price and Stress/Upside % controls live on their respective tabs (Tab 2 and Tab 3).

### Display Format
All rates/prices displayed as **percentages to 2 decimal places** (e.g., 95.00%, 8.73%). Stored internally as decimals.

### Data Flow
1. User selects strata → query SQLite
2. Run `calc_amort()` on filtered data
3. Tab 1 uses ALL loans; Tabs 2 & 3 use all active loans: Current with `last_pymnt_d == 2019-03-01` plus all delinquent (In Grace + Late 16-30 + Late 31-120 regardless of last payment date)
4. CDR from ALL loans; CPR from Current + Fully Paid loans with March 2019 last payment date (delinquent loans don't prepay); Loss severity from Charged Off subset
5. Tab 2 has purchase price input; Tab 3 has own price + stress/upside % slider

### Tab 1: Portfolio Metrics
- Credit metrics, performance metrics, transition matrix tables (existing functions)
- Age-Weighted Transition Matrix: 7-state observation-weighted average heatmap + expandable raw monthly probabilities
- Default Timing Curve: histogram + cumulative line (dual axis)
- Loan Age Status Distribution: stacked bar showing UPB by loan status at each monthly loan age

### Tab 2: Cash Flow Projection (State-Transition)
- Computed base assumptions as metric cards (CDR, Avg MDR, CPR, Loss Severity, Recovery Rate, Cumulative Default Rate)
- Pool characteristics as metric cards
- Purchase Price (%) input only — no CDR/CPR inputs (driven by transition probabilities)
- Uses `build_pool_state()` + `project_cashflows_transition()` + `solve_price_transition()`
- UPB-by-state stacked area chart, IRR display, price solver, monthly cash flow chart, expandable monthly table

### Tab 3: Scenario Comparison (State-Transition)
- Own Purchase Price (%), Stress/Upside % slider
- Uses `build_scenarios_transition()` + `compare_scenarios_transition()`
- Scenario comparison table + multi-line balance chart by scenario

---

## Coding Conventions

- PEP8, docstrings, type hints on all function signatures
- Vectorized NumPy/Pandas operations; `logging` for warnings (not `print()`)
- 2 decimal places for display; full precision internally
- No hardcoded file paths

---

## Testing

- `pytest tests/ -v` from project root
- Test files mirror src modules. See `tests/test_*.py` for all test cases.
- All 186 tests currently pass (72 portfolio_analytics, 60 cashflow_engine, 35 scenario_analysis, 19 amortization).
- `compute_pool_assumptions` CDR:
  - Create synthetic cohort: 1000 loans originated Jan 2017. In each of the 12 trailing months (Apr 2018 – Mar 2019), 5 loans default each month with $10K exposure each. Performing balance ~$8M/month. Verify avg_MDR ≈ $50K/$8M ≈ 0.625%/month, CDR = 1-(1-0.00625)^12 ≈ 7.24%
  - Zero defaults in all 12 months: all MDRs = 0, CDR = 0
  - Verify monthly_mdrs list has exactly 12 elements
  - Verify CDR round-trip: CDR → MDR via projection formula ≈ avg_mdr from observations
  - Verify cumulative_default_rate is also returned (different value from conditional CDR, and not labeled as CDR)

## Documentation

- `docs/calculations.md` — Every formula with variable definitions and assumptions
- `docs/data_cleaning.md` — Every cleaning step with rationale and row counts
- `docs/user_guide.md` — Setup, how to run, codebase overview

---

## Critical Rules

- **ALWAYS use sequential-thinking** MCP before implementing financial math.
- **ALWAYS read the relevant skill file** before writing code in that domain.
- **Run tests after any code change.** All 184 tests must pass before considering a change complete.
- **Cash flows and scenarios operate on all active loans**: Current with March 2019 last payment date plus all delinquent (In Grace + Late 16-30 + Late 31-120) regardless of last payment date.
- **CDR is computed from ALL loans in the cohort** using the dv01 conditional methodology: trailing 12-month average MDR, annualized. Cumulative default rate (NOT called CDR) retained for display only.
- **`compute_pool_assumptions()` requires `reconstruct_loan_timeline()`** on df_all first (for `default_month` and `payoff_month` columns used in conditional CDR).
- **CPR from Current + Fully Paid loans with March 2019 last payment date.** Fully Paid March 2019 loans represent payoffs that month (prepayment events). Delinquent loans are not prepaying and are excluded.
- **Loss severity is FIXED across all three scenarios** — only transition probabilities shift.
- **All base/stress/upside defaults are cohort-specific**, not global averages.
- Projection starts at t=0 (March 2019), first payment at t=1 (April 2019).
- Pool-level aggregate projections only.
- Virtual environment named `.env`.
- **State-transition model**: Defaults flow through a 5-month pipeline (Current → Delinquent → Late_1 → Late_2 → Late_3 → Charged Off). All-Current pool has zero defaults for months 1-4.
- **Transition scenario stress**: Late_3→Charged Off is NOT directly stressed — it increases mechanically via re-normalization when cure rates decrease.
- **The dashboard uses the state-transition model exclusively.** The Simple (flat CDR/CPR) functions remain in the codebase (`project_cashflows`, `solve_price`, `build_scenarios`, `compare_scenarios`) but are not imported or used by `app.py`.
